            <p>Online Round (Coding)
                Timing: 90mins.
                The first round of selection process was Coding round. There were 4
                coding questions with varying points based on their difficulty and no
                aptitude questions were asked in the first round.The platform used was
                Hackerrank. Out of these 4 questions, one was categorised as easy, two
                were medium and one was hard. Around 25 students were selected for
                next round based on their points they got in the coding round.
                
                Round 2: Technical Round - 1
                Timing: 30mins.
                This round was conducted in Physical mode held at CUIC. It started with
                my self-introduction. Then the interviewer asked my resume and he
                asked me about my projects which I mentioned in my resume. I did a
                project on Machine learning most of the questions were asked form that
                project. No technical questions other than my projects were asked for
                me in this round.
                Round 3: Technical Round -2
                Timing 40mins.
                In this round it started with my introduction. Then basic OOPs questions
                were asked, then he gave a situation and asked me to write SQL query
                based on inner join. After that one programming question was asked it
                was related to grouping anagrams in a given list of strings. After that he
                
                explained me what are all the technologies are used by the company
                and projects he is working on.
                DSA problem related to: https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
                In this round, for the programming question and SQL query we were
                asked to write it in Pen- paper mode. So for some of the students 3rd
                round was conducted like a Hybrid one in which both Technical round-2
                and HR questions were asked but for some students separate HR
                Round was conducted.
                
                Round 4: HR Round
                Timing 30mins.
                This Round was conducted like having a casual conversation with
                someone. Because my interviewer asked me questions from the things
                happened in my Life like, the recent problem I faced in my life and steps
                taken to solve it and biggest achievement in my life and some of the
                basic HR questions were asked.
                Finally, after completing all the four rounds of Interviews, Around 16
                students were selected for the Internship.
                
                TIPS
                • Practice coding problems consistently form any of the platforms
                like Hackerrank, leetcode and try to attend contests in codeforces
                regularly.
                • Have 2-3 Projects from different domain and especially from web
                development using Angular JS and a project using JAVA.
                • Be Confident and be yourself while answering questions in
                Interview.
                • Be strong in the basics of OOPs and DBMS.
                • Be ready to answer the questions asked from your projects you
                mentioned in your resume.</p>
